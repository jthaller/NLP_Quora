# NLP_Quora
Repository for Kaggle Quora Competition, using deep learning for natural language processing.

## Motivation
Before learning PyText and analyzing my downloaded facebook messages, first I some more guided practice. I will mostly be working on kaggle, but likely will truncate unecessary steps and create a more experimental and person project of my own here. I might end up using google colab for its unlimited gpu access. Even though I'm on intel's gen 10 ice lake graphics, tensorflow still resorts to only cpu usage, unlike kaggle or colab. Additionally, the training set provided includes 1.3 million examples. It seems like it'd be quite a strain on my computer to try and compute this stuff. I wonder if I still have access to the TUM computing cluster...

## Kaggle Competition Prompt
"An existential problem for any major website today is how to handle toxic and divisive content. Quora wants to tackle this problem head-on to keep their platform a place where users can feel safe sharing their knowledge with the world.

Quora is a platform that empowers people to learn from each other. On Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique insights and quality answers. A key challenge is to weed out insincere questions -- those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers.

In this competition, Kagglers will develop models that identify and flag insincere questions. To date, Quora has employed both machine learning and manual review to address this problem. With your help, they can develop more scalable methods to detect toxic and misleading content.

Here's your chance to combat online trolls at scale. Help Quora uphold their policy of “Be Nice, Be Respectful” and continue to be a place for sharing and growing the world’s knowledge."
